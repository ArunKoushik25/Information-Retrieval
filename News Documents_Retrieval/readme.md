Project Overview
This project focuses on the retrieval of relevant news documents using Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. The system scrapes the web to gather news articles, processes the content, and ranks the documents based on their relevance to user queries.

Features
Web Scraping: Extracts news documents from various sources using web scraping techniques.
Information Retrieval: Implements ranking algorithms to find and retrieve relevant news articles based on user queries.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming are applied to the documents for efficient searching.
Query Processing: Accepts user queries and returns the most relevant news articles.
Scoring Algorithm: Ranks documents based on similarity to the query using algorithms like TF-IDF or cosine similarity.
Technologies Used
Python for scripting and web scraping.
BeautifulSoup and requests libraries for web scraping.
NLTK for text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming).
Scikit-learn for implementing TF-IDF and cosine similarity.


How It Works
Web Scraping: News articles are collected from various online sources. The scraped data is stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
Text Preprocessing: The documents are tokenized, common stop words are removed, and stemming is applied to reduce words to their root form.
Indexing: The processed documents are indexed using the TF-IDF model to represent their relevance to specific terms.
Query Handling: When a user inputs a search query, the system processes the query in the same manner as the documents and retrieves the most relevant articles using cosine similarity.
Ranking: Articles are ranked and displayed based on their relevance score.
Future Enhancements
Expansion of Data Sources: Integrating more sources for news articles.
Improved Ranking: Implementing more sophisticated ranking algorithms like BM25.
User Interface: Developing a web-based interface for ease of use.
